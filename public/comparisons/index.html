      <h1>Divorce Form Kit Comparisons</h1>
      <p>

        hiring an attorney, downloading forms directly from court websites, or using
        a structured form kit like InFormer. This page provides a factual comparison

          state-specific forms without ongoing costs or upsells. InFormer does not provide
          legal advice or attorney access.

          Attorneys provide legal advice, court representation, and negotiation support that
          InFormer does not offer. For individuals with contested divorces, complex property
          divisions, or custody disputes, consulting with a licensed attorney is recommended.
          InFormer is designed for uncontested cases where both parties agree on major issues.

          Court websites provide free access to official forms, which can be a suitable
          option for individuals comfortable navigating legal paperwork independently.
          InFormer kits organize those forms into a structured package with filing
          instructions, reducing the time and effort required to assemble the correct
          documentation.
