        <h2>InFormer vs. Online Divorce Services</h2>
        <p>
          Online divorce services range from basic form generators to full-service platforms
          that include attorney review. Pricing models and included features vary widely.
          The table below outlines common differences.

          Online services that include attorney access or guided interviews may be appropriate
          for individuals who want additional support. InFormer is designed for those who want

        <h2>InFormer vs. Hiring a Divorce Attorney</h2>
        <p>
          Hiring an attorney is typically the most comprehensive option, providing legal advice,
          court representation, and negotiation assistance. However, attorney-assisted divorce
          is also the most expensive approach.

        <p>
          For individuals with contested divorces, significant assets, business ownership, or
          custody disputes, consulting with a licensed family law attorney is recommended.
          InFormer kits are designed for uncontested cases where both parties agree on
          property division, custody, and support arrangements.

        <h2>InFormer vs. DIY Court Website Forms</h2>
        <p>
          Every state court system publishes divorce forms on its official website. These
          forms are free to download, but they typically require the filer to identify,
          locate, and organize the correct documents independently.
        </p>
        <table class="comparison-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Feature</th>
              <th>InFormer</th>
              <th>DIY Court Website</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Form Organization</td><td>Pre-organized kit with all required documents</td><td>Forms scattered across multiple court pages</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Filing Instructions</td><td>Step-by-step instructions included</td><td>Varies significantly by court</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Fee Waiver Forms</td><td>Bundled in every kit</td><td>Typically on a separate page</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Children-Specific Forms</td><td>Dedicated kit option</td><td>Filer must identify correct additional forms</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Time Investment</td><td>Reduced &mdash; forms pre-selected and organized</td><td>Significant research and assembly required</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Cost</td><td>$175 or $199</td><td>Free (forms only)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Accuracy Risk</td><td>Kit matches current state requirements</td><td>Filer responsible for selecting correct versions</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
          Court websites are a suitable option for individuals comfortable navigating legal
          forms independently. InFormer adds value by organizing, packaging, and supplementing
          those forms with instructions and fee waiver documentation. For example,
          <a href="/states/california/">California divorce forms</a> span multiple Judicial
          Council documents, while <a href="/states/texas/">Texas divorce filing requirements</a>
          vary by county.

          Court filing fees are set by each state and are paid directly to the court regardless
          of which preparation method you use. Filing fees for popular states include:
          <a href="/states/california/">California</a> ($435),
          <a href="/states/florida/">Florida</a> ($400+),

        <h2>Fee Waiver &amp; Cost Savings Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Court filing fees can represent a significant expense, particularly when combined
          with form preparation costs. Most states provide a fee waiver process for individuals
          who demonstrate financial hardship.

            <tr><td>Eligibility</td><td>Based on income, public assistance enrollment, or demonstrated financial hardship</td></tr>

          Fee waiver availability and eligibility criteria differ by state. For state-specific

          <a href="/states/new-york/">New York</a>, or
