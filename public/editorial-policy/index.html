        <h2>Information Sources</h2>
        <p>
          All divorce filing information published on InFormer is based on publicly
          available court records, official state judiciary websites, and government-published
          legal resources. We do not rely on third-party legal blogs, user-generated content,
          or unverified secondary sources for filing requirements, fee schedules, or
          procedural details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each state page includes citations linking directly to the official court or
          judiciary sources used. These citations are provided so that users can independently
          verify the information presented.

        <h2>Periodic Review Process</h2>
        <p>
          Divorce filing requirements, court fees, and procedural rules can change when
          state legislatures pass new laws or courts update their administrative orders.
          InFormer reviews state-specific content on a periodic basis to identify and
          reflect these changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our review process includes checking official judiciary websites for updated
          fee schedules, revised filing procedures, and changes to residency or waiting
          period requirements. When updates are identified, the affected state pages are
          revised accordingly.

        <h2>Last Verified Dates</h2>
        <p>
          Each state page displays a "Last Verified" date directly below the page heading.
          This date indicates when the information on that page was most recently reviewed
          against official state sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          A "Last Verified" date does not guarantee that all information is current at
          the time of reading. Court fees, procedural rules, and statutory requirements
          may change between verification cycles. Users are encouraged to confirm
          critical details directly with their local court clerk's office before filing.
