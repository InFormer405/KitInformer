      <h1>Divorce Forms &amp; Filing Requirements by State (2026)</h1>
      <p>
        Divorce is governed at the state level in the United States. Each of the 50 states
        sets its own residency requirements, mandatory waiting periods, court filing fees,
        and procedural rules. The forms required, the disclosures mandated, and the fee
        waiver processes available all differ depending on where you file.
      </p>
      <p>
        InFormer provides structured, state-specific divorce form kits designed for
        uncontested cases. All filing requirement information on this site is sourced
        from official state court websites and judiciary publications. Fee waiver request
        forms are included in every kit at no additional cost.

    <!-- 2) HOW DIVORCE LAWS VARY BY STATE -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>How Divorce Laws Vary by State</h2>

        <h3>Residency Requirements Vary</h3>
        <p>
          Before a court will accept a divorce petition, the filing spouse must meet the
          state's residency requirement. These requirements exist to establish that the
          court has proper jurisdiction over the case. Residency rules differ substantially
          across states.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some states, such as <a href="/states/illinois/">Illinois</a> and
          <a href="/states/arizona/">Arizona</a>, require just 90 days of residency before
          filing. Others, including <a href="/states/california/">California</a>,
          <a href="/states/texas/">Texas</a>, and <a href="/states/florida/">Florida</a>,
          require six months. <a href="/states/new-york/">New York</a> has one of the
          longest requirements, with a continuous two-year residency period required in
          certain circumstances, or one year if the marriage took place in the state or
          the grounds for divorce arose there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Filing in the wrong jurisdiction or before meeting the residency threshold can
          result in the petition being dismissed, adding delay and additional cost. Verifying
          your state's residency requirement before preparing paperwork is a critical first step.
        </p>

        <h3>Waiting Period Differences</h3>
        <p>
          Many states impose a mandatory waiting period between the filing of the divorce
          petition and the date the court can issue a final decree. These waiting periods
          serve as a cooling-off period and vary significantly across jurisdictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="/states/florida/">Florida</a> has one of the shortest mandatory waiting
          periods at 20 days. <a href="/states/georgia/">Georgia</a> requires 30 days from
          the date the respondent is served. <a href="/states/texas/">Texas</a> and
          <a href="/states/arizona/">Arizona</a> each require 60 days.
          <a href="/states/washington/">Washington</a> and
          <a href="/states/pennsylvania/">Pennsylvania</a> impose 90-day periods.
          <a href="/states/california/">California</a> requires a full six months, and
          <a href="/states/north-carolina/">North Carolina</a> mandates a one-year
          separation before filing is even permitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="/states/new-york/">New York</a> is notable in that it does not impose
          a mandatory post-filing waiting period for uncontested divorces, though processing
          times depend on court workload and paperwork completeness.
        </p>

        <h3>Filing Fee Ranges Nationwide</h3>
        <p>
          Court filing fees are required in every state when a divorce petition is submitted.
          These fees are paid directly to the court and are separate from any costs associated
          with form preparation, attorney fees, or service of process charges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Filing fees vary widely. <a href="/states/georgia/">Georgia</a> charges approximately
          $200 to $250, while <a href="/states/california/">California</a> charges around $435.
          <a href="/states/florida/">Florida</a> fees range from $400 to $410.
          <a href="/states/new-york/">New York</a> requires a $210 filing fee plus a $125
          Request for Judicial Intervention fee. Most states fall in the $200 to $400 range,
          with exact amounts varying by county within some states.
        </p>
        <p>
          For individuals who cannot afford filing fees, most states offer a fee waiver
          process. Eligibility is typically based on income level, enrollment in public
          assistance programs, or demonstrated financial hardship. Every InFormer divorce
          kit includes the official fee waiver request forms for that state.
        </p>

        <h3>Fault vs. No-Fault States</h3>
        <p>
          All 50 states now permit some form of no-fault divorce, meaning a spouse can
          file without proving specific wrongdoing by the other party. The most commonly
          cited no-fault ground is "irreconcilable differences" or "irretrievable
          breakdown of the marriage."
        </p>
        <p>
          However, many states also retain fault-based grounds. States like
          <a href="/states/texas/">Texas</a>, <a href="/states/new-york/">New York</a>,
          <a href="/states/georgia/">Georgia</a>,
          <a href="/states/north-carolina/">North Carolina</a>, and
          <a href="/states/pennsylvania/">Pennsylvania</a> allow both no-fault and
          fault-based filings. Fault-based grounds may include adultery, abandonment,
          cruelty, or imprisonment. Whether filing on fault-based grounds affects
          property division, spousal support, or custody outcomes depends on the
          specific state's statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          States like <a href="/states/california/">California</a>,
          <a href="/states/florida/">Florida</a>,
          <a href="/states/illinois/">Illinois</a>,
          <a href="/states/arizona/">Arizona</a>, and
          <a href="/states/washington/">Washington</a> are purely no-fault states.
          In these jurisdictions, the court does not consider allegations of
          misconduct when granting the divorce.
        </p>

        <h3>Parenting Classes &amp; Mediation</h3>
        <p>
          When minor children are involved in a divorce, many states require one or both
          parents to complete a court-approved parenting education course before the
          divorce can be finalized. These courses typically cover the impact of divorce
          on children, co-parenting communication, and conflict resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some states also require or strongly encourage mediation for custody and
          visitation disputes before the court will schedule a hearing. Mediation
          requirements vary by state and sometimes by county. Whether a parenting
          class is mandatory, optional, or county-specific is detailed on each
          state's filing requirements page.
        </p>
        <p>
          InFormer offers separate kit options for cases with and without minor children.
          The "With Children" kit includes the additional forms and documentation
          typically required when children are part of the case, including parenting
          plan templates where applicable.
