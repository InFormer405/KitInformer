        <h2>Divorce Filing Requirements Vary by State</h2>
        <p>
          Each state sets its own residency rules for divorce eligibility. Some states require
          as little as six weeks of residency, while others require six months or more. Filing
          in the wrong jurisdiction or before meeting residency requirements can result in your
          case being dismissed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mandatory waiting periods also differ significantly. Certain states allow divorce
          finalization within weeks of filing, while others impose waiting periods of 60 days,
          90 days, or longer before a court will issue a final decree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Court filing fees range from under $100 to over $400 depending on the state and county.
          Many courts offer fee waiver programs for individuals who meet financial eligibility
          criteria. InFormer kits include the official fee waiver request forms for every state.

          <li>Separate kit options for cases with children and without children</li>
          <li>Flat one-time pricing &mdash; $175 (no children) or $199 (with children)</li>

        <h2>Why InFormer Is Different</h2>

        <div class="comparison-block">
          <h3>InFormer vs. Online Divorce Services</h3>
          <ul class="comparison-list">
            <li>InFormer charges a one-time flat fee with no recurring monthly billing. Many online divorce services use subscription pricing or add charges as you progress through their process.</li>
            <li>Every InFormer kit includes official fee waiver request forms at no additional cost. Most online services do not bundle fee waiver documentation.</li>
            <li>InFormer does not upsell attorney consultations, legal review add-ons, or premium tiers. The kit price is the complete price.</li>
            <li>InFormer provides self-help forms only and does not provide legal advice. Online services that include attorney access may offer guidance InFormer does not.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="comparison-block">
          <h3>InFormer vs. Hiring a Divorce Attorney</h3>
          <ul class="comparison-list">
            <li>Attorney-assisted divorce typically costs $1,500 to $5,000 or more depending on case complexity. InFormer kits are priced at $175 or $199 as a one-time payment.</li>
            <li>Attorneys provide legal advice, court representation, and negotiation support that InFormer does not offer. For contested cases or complex asset divisions, legal counsel may be necessary.</li>
            <li>InFormer kits allow individuals to prepare and file paperwork at their own pace without scheduling around an attorney's availability.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="comparison-block">
          <h3>InFormer vs. DIY Court Website Forms</h3>
          <ul class="comparison-list">
            <li>Court websites typically require users to locate, download, and organize individual forms from multiple pages. InFormer provides a pre-organized kit with all required documents in one package.</li>
            <li>InFormer includes step-by-step filing instructions alongside the forms. Court websites vary in the level of procedural guidance they provide.</li>
            <li>Fee waiver forms are bundled in every InFormer kit. On court websites, fee waiver documentation is often located separately from divorce forms.</li>
            <li>InFormer offers dedicated kit options for cases with and without children. Court websites require filers to independently identify which additional forms apply to their situation.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="comparison-note">
          InFormer provides structured self-help legal forms. We do not provide legal advice.
          Individuals with contested cases or complex legal issues should consider consulting an attorney.

        <h2>Understanding Divorce Filing in the United States</h2>

        <h3>No-Fault Divorce Laws</h3>
        <p>
          All 50 states now allow some form of no-fault divorce, meaning a spouse can
          file without proving wrongdoing by the other party. The most commonly cited
          ground is "irreconcilable differences" or "irretrievable breakdown of the marriage."
          For example, <a href="/states/california/">California divorce forms</a> are built
          around no-fault grounds exclusively, while states like
          <a href="/states/new-york/">New York</a> also retain certain fault-based options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some states also retain fault-based grounds such as adultery, abandonment, or cruelty.
          Whether fault-based grounds affect property division or custody outcomes depends on the
          jurisdiction. State-specific details are available on each state's filing requirements page.
        </p>

        <h3>Contested vs. Uncontested Divorce</h3>
        <p>
          An uncontested divorce occurs when both spouses agree on all major issues, including
          property division, child custody, and support arrangements. These cases typically
          involve less paperwork, lower costs, and shorter timelines than contested proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
          InFormer divorce form kits are designed for uncontested cases. Individuals facing
          disagreements over assets, custody, or support may need to consult with a family
          law attorney to address those issues.
        </p>

        <h3>Financial Disclosure Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          Most states require both parties to complete financial disclosure forms as part
          of the divorce process. These documents typically include income statements,
          asset inventories, debt schedules, and monthly expense summaries. In
          <a href="/states/texas/">Texas</a>, for instance, a sworn inventory and
          appraisement is commonly required alongside the petition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specific forms and deadlines for financial disclosures vary by state. Failing
          to submit required disclosures can delay proceedings or result in court sanctions.
          Each InFormer kit identifies the disclosure obligations applicable to that state.
        </p>

        <h3>Parenting Plan Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          When minor children are involved, most courts require a parenting plan that outlines
          custody arrangements, visitation schedules, and decision-making responsibilities.
          Some states also mandate completion of a parenting education course before the
          divorce can be finalized &mdash; <a href="/states/florida/">Florida divorce filings</a>
          involving children, for example, require an approved parenting course.
        </p>
        <p>
          InFormer offers separate kit options for cases with and without children.
          The "With Children" kit includes the additional forms and documentation
          typically required when minor children are part of the case.
        </p>

        <h3>Filing Timeline Expectations</h3>
        <p>
          The time between filing and finalization varies widely. Some states have no
          mandatory waiting period, while others require 30 to 90 days or more before
          a court will enter a final decree.
          <a href="/states/illinois/">Illinois divorce filing requirements</a> include a
          mandatory waiting period, while <a href="/states/nevada/">Nevada</a> is known
          for one of the shortest processing timelines in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, uncontested cases with properly completed paperwork move through
          the system more quickly than contested or incomplete filings. Accurate,
          state-specific documentation can help reduce avoidable delays.
