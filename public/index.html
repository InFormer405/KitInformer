        <h2>Divorce Filing Requirements Vary by State</h2>
        <p>
          Each state sets its own residency rules for divorce eligibility. Some states require
          as little as six weeks of residency, while others require six months or more. Filing
          in the wrong jurisdiction or before meeting residency requirements can result in your
          case being dismissed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mandatory waiting periods also differ significantly. Certain states allow divorce
          finalization within weeks of filing, while others impose waiting periods of 60 days,
          90 days, or longer before a court will issue a final decree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Court filing fees range from under $100 to over $400 depending on the state and county.
          Many courts offer fee waiver programs for individuals who meet financial eligibility
          criteria. InFormer kits include the official fee waiver request forms for every state.
