        <h2>How Divorce Works in California</h2>
        <p>
          The divorce process in California begins when one spouse files a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage
          with the Superior Court in the appropriate county. After filing, the petition and related documents
          must be formally served on the other spouse according to California rules of service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both parties are required to complete and exchange mandatory financial disclosures, which include
          detailed information about income, assets, debts, and expenses. These disclosures must be filed
          with the court before a divorce can be finalized.
        </p>
        <p>
          California imposes a mandatory six-month waiting period from the date the respondent is served
          before a final judgment of dissolution can be entered. If both parties agree on all terms and the
          case is uncontested, it may proceed without a trial. Contested cases may require additional hearings
          or court involvement.

          Choosing between a DIY divorce system and hiring an attorney in California
          depends on the complexity of your case, budget considerations, and whether
          both parties agree on major terms. Self-help divorce systems are typically
          most appropriate for uncontested situations.
