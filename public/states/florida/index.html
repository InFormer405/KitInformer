        <h2>How to File for Divorce in Florida</h2>
        <p>
          The following outlines the general process for filing an uncontested
          dissolution of marriage in Florida. Individual circumstances, county
          procedures, or contested issues may affect the specific steps required.
        </p>
        <ol class="step-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Confirm residency eligibility.</strong> At least one spouse
            must have been a resident of Florida for at least six months before
            filing. Residency can be established through a valid Florida
            driver's license, voter registration, or other documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete the Petition for Dissolution of Marriage.</strong>
            Florida uses standardized Supreme Court Approved Family Law Forms.
            For cases without children, use Form 12.901(b)(1). For cases with
            minor children, use Form 12.901(b)(2). The petition identifies
            both parties, states the grounds for dissolution (irretrievably
            broken marriage), and outlines the relief requested.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File the petition with the Clerk of the Circuit Court.</strong>
            Submit the completed petition and any required attachments to the
            Clerk of the Circuit Court in the county where either spouse resides.
            Pay the filing fee (typically $400 to $410) or submit an Application
            for Determination of Civil Indigent Status if eligible for a fee waiver.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Serve the other spouse.</strong> Florida law requires formal
            service of process on the non-filing spouse. Service may be completed
            by a sheriff, certified process server, or through certified mail
            in some circumstances. If the respondent agrees, they may file a
            Notice of Appearance or Waiver acknowledging receipt.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete mandatory financial disclosures.</strong> Both
            parties must file a Financial Affidavit (Form 12.902(b) or (c)
            depending on income level) disclosing all income, expenses,
            assets, and liabilities. These disclosures are required even
            in uncontested cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete the parenting course (if children are involved).</strong>
            Florida requires both parents to complete an approved Parent Education
            and Family Stabilization Course when minor children are part of the
            case. The course must be completed before the final hearing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wait for the mandatory 20-day period.</strong> Florida
            imposes a minimum 20-day waiting period from the date the petition
            is filed before a final hearing can be scheduled. Courts may
            waive this period in certain circumstances.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Attend the final hearing.</strong> In an uncontested
            dissolution, the petitioner appears before the judge for a brief
            final hearing. The judge reviews the settlement agreement, confirms
            both parties consent to the terms, and signs the Final Judgment
            of Dissolution of Marriage. The divorce is final once the judge
            signs the judgment.
          </li>
