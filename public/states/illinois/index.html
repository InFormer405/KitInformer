        <h2>How to File for Divorce in Illinois</h2>
        <p>
          The following outlines the general process for filing an uncontested
          dissolution of marriage in Illinois. Individual circumstances, county
          procedures, or contested issues may affect the specific steps required.
        </p>
        <ol class="step-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Confirm residency eligibility.</strong> At least one spouse
            must have been a resident of Illinois for at least 90 days before
            filing. The petition is filed in the circuit court of the county
            where either spouse resides.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Petition for Dissolution of Marriage.</strong>
            The petition is the document that formally initiates the case. It
            identifies both parties, states the grounds for dissolution
            (irreconcilable differences, the sole ground in Illinois), and
            outlines the relief requested regarding property division, support,
            and, if applicable, child custody and parenting time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File the petition with the Circuit Clerk.</strong> Submit
            the completed petition and any required attachments to the Circuit
            Clerk's office in the appropriate county. Pay the filing fee
            (typically $250 to $388 depending on the county) or submit an
            Application for Waiver of Court Fees if eligible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Serve the respondent.</strong> Illinois requires that the
            non-filing spouse receive formal notice of the proceedings. Service
            can be completed by a sheriff, special process server, or by
            publication in certain circumstances. In uncontested cases, the
            respondent may file an Entry of Appearance and Waiver of Service,
            acknowledging the case without formal service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Satisfy the separation requirement.</strong> Illinois
            requires the parties to have lived separate and apart for a
            continuous period of six months before the court may enter a
            judgment of dissolution. However, this requirement can be waived
            if both parties agree in writing, which is common in uncontested
            cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete financial disclosures.</strong> Both parties must
            exchange financial information including income, assets, debts,
            and expenses. Illinois requires a Financial Affidavit or
            disclosure statement. In cases involving children, both parties
            must also complete a Child Support Worksheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete the parenting education program (if children
            are involved).</strong> Illinois requires parents to complete
            a court-approved parenting education program when minor children
            are part of the case, unless the court waives this requirement.
            A parenting plan or allocation judgment addressing custody
            (allocation of parental responsibilities) and parenting time
            must also be prepared.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Attend the prove-up hearing.</strong> In an uncontested
            dissolution, the petitioner appears before the judge for a brief
            prove-up hearing. The judge reviews the settlement agreement,
            confirms both parties consent to the terms, and enters the
            Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage. The divorce is final once
            the judge signs the judgment.
          </li>
        </ol>
