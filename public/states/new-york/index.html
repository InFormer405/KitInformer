        <h2>How to File for Divorce in New York</h2>
        <p>
          The following outlines the general process for filing an uncontested
          divorce in New York. Individual circumstances, county procedures, or
          contested issues may affect the specific steps required.
        </p>
        <ol class="step-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Confirm residency eligibility.</strong> New York has
            multiple residency paths. If both spouses are New York residents
            at the time of filing, a one-year continuous residency is required.
            If the marriage took place in New York or the grounds for divorce
            arose in New York, one year of continuous residency by either
            spouse is sufficient. Otherwise, at least one spouse must have
            been a continuous resident for two years before filing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Summons and Complaint or Summons with Notice.</strong>
            The Summons with Notice is the most common method for initiating
            an uncontested divorce. It identifies the parties, states the
            grounds for divorce (typically irretrievable breakdown for at
            least six months under DRL &sect;170(7)), and specifies the
            relief sought. Alternatively, a Verified Complaint may be filed
            with additional detail.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Purchase an Index Number from the County Clerk.</strong>
            Before filing, you must purchase an Index Number from the County
            Clerk's office in the county where the action will be filed.
            The filing fee is $210. A separate $125 Request for Judicial
            Intervention (RJI) fee is required when the case is ready for
            court review.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Serve the defendant.</strong> New York requires personal
            service of the Summons with Notice or Summons and Complaint on
            the non-filing spouse. Service must be performed by a person
            who is not a party to the action and who is at least 18 years
            old. An Affidavit of Service must then be filed with the court
            as proof.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wait for the defendant's response.</strong> After service,
            the defendant has 20 days to respond if served in person within
            New York, or 30 days if served by another method. In an
            uncontested case, the defendant typically signs an Affidavit of
            Defendant acknowledging receipt and waiving the right to answer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete financial disclosures.</strong> Both parties must
            file a Statement of Net Worth listing income, expenses, assets,
            and liabilities. In uncontested cases, a Sworn Statement of
            Removal of Barriers to Remarriage (if applicable) and other
            required affidavits must also be prepared.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the uncontested divorce packet.</strong> Compile
            the full set of documents including the Note of Issue, Findings
            of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Judgment of Divorce, Part 130
            Certification, and a separation or settlement agreement signed
            by both parties and notarized. If children are involved, include
            the Child Support Worksheet and related custody provisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Submit the packet to the court for review.</strong> File
            the completed uncontested divorce packet with the County Clerk
            along with the RJI fee. A judge reviews the documents without
            a hearing in most uncontested cases. If the paperwork is in
            order, the judge signs the Judgment of Divorce and the divorce
            becomes final.
