        <h2>How to File for Divorce in Ohio</h2>
        <p>
          The following outlines the general process for filing an uncontested
          dissolution of marriage in Ohio. Ohio distinguishes between
          "divorce" (where one party files against the other) and
          "dissolution" (where both parties file jointly by agreement).
          This guide covers the dissolution process, which is the most
          common path for uncontested cases. Individual circumstances or
          county procedures may affect the specific steps required.
        </p>
        <ol class="step-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Confirm residency eligibility.</strong> At least one
            spouse must have been a resident of Ohio for at least six months
            and a resident of the county where the petition will be filed
            for at least 90 days before filing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reach agreement on all terms.</strong> In a dissolution,
            both parties must agree on all issues before filing, including
            property division, spousal support, and, if applicable, child
            custody (allocation of parental rights and responsibilities),
            parenting time, and child support. These terms are documented
            in a Separation Agreement signed by both spouses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Petition for Dissolution of Marriage.</strong>
            The petition is filed jointly by both spouses. It includes
            the Separation Agreement and identifies both parties, the date
            and place of marriage, the names and birth dates of any minor
            children, and a statement that both parties desire dissolution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File the petition with the Clerk of Courts.</strong>
            Submit the completed petition, Separation Agreement, and any
            required local forms to the Clerk of Courts in the Domestic
            Relations Division of the Court of Common Pleas. Pay the
            filing fee (typically $200 to $350 depending on the county)
            or file an Affidavit of Indigency if eligible for a fee waiver.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete financial disclosures.</strong> Both parties
            must prepare and exchange financial disclosure statements
            listing all income, assets, debts, and expenses. Ohio courts
            require full financial transparency even in agreed cases. If
            children are involved, both parties must also complete a
            Child Support Computation Worksheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete the parenting education program (if children
            are involved).</strong> While Ohio does not have a statewide
            mandate, many counties require parents to complete a
            court-approved parenting education program when minor children
            are part of the case. Check with the local Domestic Relations
            Division for county-specific requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wait for the hearing window.</strong> Ohio requires
            a waiting period of 30 to 90 days from the date the petition
            is filed before a final hearing can be held. The court
            schedules the hearing within this window. Both parties must
            appear at the hearing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Attend the final hearing.</strong> Both spouses appear
            before the judge at the final hearing. The judge reviews the
            Separation Agreement, confirms both parties entered into it
            voluntarily, and verifies that the terms are fair and
            equitable. If the court approves, the judge signs the Decree
            of Dissolution and the marriage is officially terminated.
          </li>
        </ol>
