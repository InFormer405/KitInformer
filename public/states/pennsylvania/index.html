        <h2>How to File for Divorce in Pennsylvania</h2>
        <p>
          The following outlines the general process for filing a no-fault
          uncontested divorce in Pennsylvania with mutual consent. Individual
          circumstances, county procedures, or contested issues may affect
          the specific steps required.
        </p>
        <ol class="step-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Confirm residency eligibility.</strong> At least one
            spouse must have been a bona fide resident of Pennsylvania for
            at least six months before filing. The complaint is filed in the
            Court of Common Pleas in the county where either spouse resides.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Divorce Complaint.</strong> The complaint
            initiates the divorce action and identifies both parties, the
            date and place of marriage, the grounds for divorce, and the
            relief requested. For a no-fault divorce with mutual consent,
            the complaint is filed under Section 3301(c) of the Pennsylvania
            Divorce Code. If mutual consent is not available, a two-year
            separation under Section 3301(d) may be used instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File the complaint with the Prothonotary.</strong>
            Submit the completed complaint and any required cover sheets
            to the Prothonotary's office in the appropriate county. Pay the
            filing fee (typically $200 to $350 depending on the county)
            or file a Petition to Proceed In Forma Pauperis if eligible
            for a fee waiver.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Serve the defendant.</strong> Pennsylvania requires
            that the non-filing spouse be formally served with the divorce
            complaint. Service is typically handled by the sheriff's office
            or a competent adult who is not a party to the action. The
            defendant may also accept service voluntarily by signing an
            Acceptance of Service form.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wait for the mandatory 90-day period.</strong>
            Under Section 3301(c), a 90-day waiting period begins from
            the date the defendant is served with the divorce complaint.
            No affidavits of consent can be filed until this 90-day
            period has elapsed. This waiting period is a statutory
            requirement and cannot be shortened.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File the Affidavits of Consent.</strong> After the
            90-day waiting period, both spouses must sign and file
            separate Affidavits of Consent confirming that the marriage
            is irretrievably broken and that each party consents to the
            divorce. Both affidavits must be filed with the court before
            the divorce can proceed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete financial disclosures and property settlement.</strong>
            Both parties should prepare and exchange information about
            income, assets, debts, and expenses. A marital settlement
            agreement addressing property division, spousal support, and
            (if applicable) child custody, support, and visitation should
            be drafted and signed by both parties. If children are involved,
            many counties require completion of a parenting education
            program.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File the Praecipe to Transmit Record and Divorce Decree.</strong>
            Once the affidavits and settlement agreement are filed, submit
            a Praecipe to Transmit Record to the court requesting entry of
            the divorce decree. A judge reviews the documents and, if
            everything is in order, signs the Divorce Decree. The divorce
            is final once the decree is entered by the court. No hearing
            is required in most uncontested mutual consent cases.
          </li>
