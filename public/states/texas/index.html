      <h1>Texas Divorce Forms & State-Specific Legal Form Kits</h1>

      <p>
        Filing for divorce in Texas requires state-specific forms, strict formatting, and compliance with court filing standards. Texas courts do not accept generic national templates. Each divorce case must follow Texas statutes, residency requirements, and procedural timelines to move forward properly.
      </p>

      <p>
        InFormer Texas Divorce Kits are designed specifically for individuals seeking an organized, step-by-step system for uncontested divorce cases. Each kit includes structured Texas-specific divorce forms and detailed filing instructions aligned with Texas court expectations. Our goal is clarity — helping individuals move forward confidently without unnecessary confusion or avoidable rejection issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typical Texas divorce filing fees range from $250 to $350 depending on the county. For individuals who qualify, Texas courts offer a filing fee waiver. Every InFormer Divorce Kit includes the official Texas fee waiver request form at no additional cost. While approval is determined by the court and not guaranteed, this inclusion helps many individuals reduce upfront financial strain during an already difficult time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether filing with or without minor children, Texas divorce cases require careful attention to documentation, timelines, and court procedures. Our state-specific structure eliminates guesswork by organizing required forms, providing clear filing steps, and explaining what happens at each stage of the process.

      <h2>How to File for Divorce in Texas (Step-by-Step Guide)</h2>

      <p>
        Filing for divorce in Texas requires meeting residency rules,
        completing state-specific forms, and following court filing procedures.
        Below is a general overview of the uncontested divorce process.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 1 – Meet Texas Residency Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        In Texas, at least one spouse must have lived in the state for six months
        and in the filing county for at least 90 days before filing.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2 – Complete Required Texas Divorce Forms</h3>
      <p>
        Texas requires specific court-approved forms. Using state-specific
        divorce documents helps reduce formatting errors and rejection risk.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 3 – File Forms With the Court</h3>
      <p>
        Divorce petitions are filed with the District Court in the appropriate county.
        Texas divorce filing fees typically range between $250 and $350 depending on the county.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 4 – Serve Your Spouse</h3>
      <p>
        The filed paperwork must be formally served on the other spouse
        according to Texas service requirements.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 5 – Complete the Waiting Period</h3>
      <p>
        Texas requires a mandatory 60-day waiting period from the date
        the divorce petition is filed before a divorce can be finalized.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 6 – Finalize the Divorce Decree</h3>
      <p>
        After required waiting periods and paperwork review,
        the court may issue a final decree of divorce.
      </p>

        and document preparation costs. Attorney representation can
