        <h2>How to File for Divorce in Texas</h2>
        <p>
          The following outlines the general process for filing an uncontested
          divorce in Texas. Individual circumstances, county-specific rules, or
          contested issues may affect the steps required.
        </p>
        <ol class="step-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Confirm residency eligibility.</strong> At least one spouse
            must have been a Texas resident for at least six months and a
            resident of the county where the petition will be filed for at
            least 90 days.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Original Petition for Divorce.</strong> The
            petition is the document that formally initiates the divorce case.
            It identifies both spouses, states the grounds for divorce (most
            commonly insupportability), and outlines the relief being
            requested, including property division and, if applicable,
            child custody arrangements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File the petition with the District Clerk.</strong> Submit
            the completed petition to the District Clerk's office in the
            county where either spouse resides. Pay the filing fee (typically
            $250 to $350) or file a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment
            of Court Costs if eligible for a fee waiver.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Serve the respondent.</strong> Texas law requires the
            non-filing spouse to be formally notified of the divorce
            proceeding. Service can be accomplished through a process server,
            constable, or sheriff. Alternatively, the respondent may sign a
            Waiver of Service, which is common in uncontested cases where
            both parties agree.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wait for the mandatory 60-day cooling-off period.</strong>
            Texas requires a minimum 60-day waiting period from the date the
            petition is filed before a court can grant the divorce. No final
            decree can be entered during this period.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete financial disclosures.</strong> Both parties
            should prepare a sworn inventory and appraisement listing all
            community and separate property, debts, and financial obligations.
            While not always required in agreed divorces, courts may request
            this documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Draft the Final Decree of Divorce.</strong> The decree is
            the court order that finalizes the divorce. It addresses property
            division, spousal support if applicable, and child custody and
            support arrangements if minor children are involved. Both parties
            should review and sign the decree before submission.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Attend the prove-up hearing.</strong> In an uncontested
            divorce, the petitioner typically appears before the judge for a
            brief hearing to confirm the terms of the agreement. The judge
            reviews the decree, asks a series of standard questions, and
            signs the final order if everything is in order. The divorce is
            final once the judge signs the decree.
          </li>
        </ol>
