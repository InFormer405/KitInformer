      <h2>About Virginia Legal Form Kits</h2>
      <p>
        Legal forms are not one-size-fits-all. Virginia has its own rules, formatting expectations, and statutory
        language requirements that differ from other states. Using the wrong form — or a generic version — can lead
        to delays, rejections, or the need to resubmit documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Virginia Legal Form Kits are built with these realities in mind. Each kit focuses on common use cases
        where state-specific structure matters, helping individuals prepare documents that align with Virginia
        expectations from the start.

      <h2>Fee Waiver Forms Included</h2>
      <p>
        Each kit includes fee waiver forms and guidance at no additional cost.
        Approval is determined by the court and depends on individual eligibility.

      <h2>Why State-Specific Forms Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Virginia forms often differ in terminology, layout, and required disclosures compared to other states.
        Even small differences can affect whether a document is accepted or requires revision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Virginia-specific forms reduces uncertainty and helps ensure documents are prepared in a way that
        aligns with how Virginia entities review and process them.
